# Problem Explanation: Making a Binary String Alternating
## Problem Statement
Given a binary string s consisting of characters '0' and '1', we need to perform operations to make it alternating (no two adjacent characters are the same). We can erase any character from the string any number of times. We need to find:

The minimum number of operations (erasures) required to make the string alternating.

The number of different shortest sequences of operations that achieve this, modulo 998244353.

## Key Insights
Alternating String: An alternating string can either start with '0' (like "0101...") or '1' (like "1010...").

Minimum Operations: The minimum operations needed is the total length minus the length of the longest possible alternating subsequence we can keep.

Counting Sequences: The number of ways to achieve this minimum is related to how we can choose which duplicate characters to remove from consecutive blocks.

## Solution Approach
Find the Longest Alternating Subsequence: Traverse the string and count how many times the character changes. This gives us the length of the longest possible alternating string we can keep (altr_ in the code).

Calculate Minimum Operations: The minimum operations required is n - altr_ where n is the original string length.

Count Valid Sequences: For each block of consecutive identical characters, we can choose any order to remove all but one character. The number of ways is the product of the factorials of the counts of these blocks minus one.

## code Explanation
Factorial Precomputation: We precompute factorials up to the maximum possible string length (2e5) modulo 998244353 to efficiently calculate combinations later.

Processing Each String:

We traverse the string to count blocks of consecutive identical characters.

For each block of length cnt, we multiply our answer by cnt (representing choices of which characters to keep).

We count the length of the longest alternating subsequence (altr_).

Final Calculation:

The minimum operations is n - altr_.

The number of sequences is the product of the counts of each block multiplied by the factorial of the total operations (representing permutations of operations).
