# D. Strong Vertices

## link : https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1857/D

Given two arrays a and b, both of length n.
Elements of both arrays indexed from 1 to n. 
You are constructing a directed graph, where edge from u to v (u≠v) exists if au−av≥bu−bv.

A vertex V is called strong if there exists a path from V
 to all other vertices.
