#Year - 2024

Over the 2024 year , I have worked on improving my programming skills and solving problems across various topics.

Academic and Programming Journey Subjects Studied in the First Year

Programming Languages:

Basic C Programming Basic C++ Programming Data Structures and Algorithms:


*** Basic Data Structures (e.g., arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists)

*** Graph Theory (basics and applications)

*** Tree Structures (including Segment Trees)

*** Mathematics and Theoretical Concepts: (  Number Theory , Basic Math)
                                
Problem-Solving Highlights

Solved over 700+ problems on various online judges within the first year.

Topics covered include:

* Sorting and Searching
*  Dynamic Programming
* Graph Traversals
* Mathematical and Logical Problems

Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a public archive of all the problems I have solved during this time. 
It is structured to organize solutions by  weeks, making it easier to navigate and review the work.
